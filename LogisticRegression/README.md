# Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and campaign-related features. The dataset is sourced from a Portuguese banking institution.

## Project Overview

- Problem Type: Binary Classification  
- Objective: Predict the target variable y (yes/no for term deposit subscription)  
- Dataset: bank.csv (UCI Bank Marketing Dataset)

## Steps Performed

1. Handled missing data & verified nulls  
2. Removed 1,784 duplicate entries  
3. Detected and treated outliers using IQR  
4. Applied Label Encoding to categorical variables  
5. Dropped irrelevant columns like pdays, poutcome, etc. (based on high VIF)  
6. Checked for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  
7. Split data using train_test_split (70% train, 30% test)  
8. Built and trained Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn

## Model Evaluation

| Metric             | Result       |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Accuracy Score     | ~88.48%      |
| Confusion Matrix   | [[9558, 25], [1225, 46]] |
| Precision / Recall | Calculated using classification report |

Interpretation: The model performs well, though slightly imbalanced in predicting the "yes" class. Could be improved further with class weighting or ensemble models.
