# 🏏 Cricket Player Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment international cricket players based on their performance statistics. The goal is to identify distinct player types (e.g., aggressive batters, all-rounders, bowlers) using unsupervised learning.

## Project Overview

- Problem Type: Unsupervised Learning – Clustering  
- Objective: Group players into meaningful clusters based on performance metrics  
- Dataset: cricket_clean.csv (preprocessed performance stats)

## Features in Dataset

| Feature         | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Player Name      | Name of the cricketer                  |
| Matches Played   | Total matches played                   |
| Batting Average  | Average runs scored per innings        |
| Strike Rate      | Batting strike rate                    |
| Bowling Average  | Average runs conceded per wicket       |
| Economy Rate     | Bowling economy                        |
| ...              | Additional skill-based features        |

## Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Handled outliers using IQR and visual inspection  
3. Normalized features using StandardScaler  
4. Used Elbow Method & Silhouette Score to choose optimal K  
5. Applied KMeans Clustering with K=4  
6. Visualized clusters in 2D space using PCA-reduced components

## Results

- Optimal Clusters: 4  
- Cluster Distribution: Aggressive Batters, Balanced All-Rounders, Specialist Bowlers, Support Roles  
- Used PCA for dimensionality reduction before plotting

## Key Learnings

- How K-Means works and the importance of normalization  
- How to determine optimal K using Elbow and Silhouette methods  
- PCA helps simplify visualization for high-dimensional data  
- Valuable insights can be derived from unsupervised learning on sports data
