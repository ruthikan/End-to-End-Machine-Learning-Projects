# 💻 Machine Learning Projects  – Ruthika Nalajala

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio! 👋  
This repository contains all the ML projects I’ve worked on during my learning journey with IntelPath and personal practice. Each project is built from scratch using real-world datasets and covers EDA, model building, evaluation, and tuning.
