# 🌲 Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on their subscription, service, and account details. I implemented Random Forest — a powerful ensemble model — along with RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This project is part of my ML journey through IntelPath.

## 📁 Project Overview

- 📊 Problem Type: Binary Classification  
- 🎯 Objective: Predict whether a telecom customer will churn  
- 📂 Dataset: customer_churn.csv (7,043 rows × 21 columns)

## 🔍 Features in Dataset

| Feature           | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| gender            | Male or Female                             |
| SeniorCitizen     | Whether the customer is a senior citizen   |
| Partner           | Has a partner (Yes/No)                     |
| Dependents        | Has dependents (Yes/No)                    |
| tenure            | Number of months with the company          |
| PhoneService      | Whether phone service is active            |
| MultipleLines     | Whether customer has multiple lines        |
| InternetService   | Type of internet service                   |
| OnlineSecurity    | Whether online security is active          |
| ...               | ...more features (see dataset)             |
| TotalCharges      | Total bill amount (continuous)             |
| Churn             | Target variable (Yes = churned, No = retained) |

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. ✅ Loaded dataset and performed EDA  
2. ✅ Handled missing values in TotalCharges  
3. ✅ Removed customerID (irrelevant to prediction)  
4. ✅ Applied Label Encoding to all categorical variables  
5. ✅ Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%)  
6. ✅ Trained a baseline Random Forest model (n_estimators=50)  
7. ✅ Used RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters:
   - n_estimators
   - max_depth
   - min_samples_leaf
   - min_samples_split
   - criterion (gini/entropy)

## ⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)

| Best Parameters Found | Value           |
|------------------------|----------------|
| n_estimators           | 300            |
| max_depth              | 10             |
| min_samples_leaf       | 4              |
| min_samples_split      | 2              |
| criterion              | entropy        |

## 📈 Model Evaluation

| Metric           | Score          |
|------------------|----------------|
| Baseline Accuracy | 77.82%         |
| Tuned Accuracy    | 78.96% ✅      |
| Confusion Matrix  | Included in notebook |
| Feature Importance | Visualized using barplot |

✅ Interpretation: Model performance improved after tuning. Features like tenure, Contract type, and MonthlyCharges had the highest influence on churn prediction.
